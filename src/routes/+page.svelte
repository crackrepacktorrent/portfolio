			A playable concept for a point-n-click 2D adventure made with Godot and Popochiu.

		<p>
			A catastrophic climate collapse forces humanity to flee Earth. Take control of Nova—a horse's cryogenically preserved head
			accidentally reanimated after 3000 years when his chamber leaks onto a John Deere android
			mow-bot. Once the beloved companion of Chevy, a Texan farmer who couldn't bear to leave his
			trusty steed behind during the evacuation, Nova must navigate a transformed Earth abandoned by
			the NEIGH program (Nationwide Evacuation to Intergalactic Habitable Sanctuaries). With his
			consciousness now inhabiting farm machinery, Nova embarks on a bizarre journey through a world
			reclaimed by nature, searching for answers about what remains of the universe and the fate of
			his human companion.

			A demo for an anti(?)-dating sim made with Ren'Py that explores the idea of mankeeping.
		</p>
		<p>
			Inspired by Ferrara and Vergara's 2024 research on "mankeeping," fiximupim explores the heavy
			emotional labor women pick up in heterosexual relationships. Play as one of god's angels,
			entrusted with rehabilitating men you've been matched to before breaking up with them and
			releasing them into the dating sphere. Players navigate the challenging task of cultivating
			six key traits in their virtual partners—from emotional intelligence to responsibility.
			Fiximupim balances playful game mechanics with social critique, creating an introspective
			experience for anyone who's ever thought, "I can fix him."

			An audiovisualizer crafted in ChucK and ChuGL that transforms sound into a letter (of sorts).
		</p>
		<p>
			Inspired by the question "how can i make a visualizer write me a letter?", this visualizer
			algorithmically generates words whose properties - rotation, spacing, length, number of
			samples shown, color, and line thickness - respond directly to audio input. The visualizer
			analyzes incoming sound using RMS and maximum amplitude to control various parameters of the
			writing. Punctuation is added during musical pauses, and the writing speed and content shift
			in response to the audio's characteristics.
